# HR Analytics Project

## Project Overview
The HR Analytics Project is designed to help HR teams gain valuable insights into employee performance, turnover, retrenchment trends, and promotions. By utilizing Power BI for data visualization, this project enables data-driven decision-making to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and operational efficiency within organizations.

The project consists of data analysis on several datasets, providing actionable insights into key HR metrics that support workforce planning and optimization strategies.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze and visualize employee demographics, performance, and satisfaction data.
- To identify trends in promotions and retrenchment across departments.
- To support strategic workforce planning with data-driven insights on retention and turnover.
- To optimize promotion policies and identify performance gaps.
- To provide HR teams with a comprehensive view of employee-related metrics to drive better decision-making.

## Specific KPIs / Key Project Steps

### 1. **Promotion Trends**
- **KPI:** Track promotion rates across various departments and job roles over time.
- **Steps:**
  - Import promotion data (`promotion.csv`) into Power BI.
  - Use Power Query to clean and prepare the data.
  - Create visualizations to display promotion rates and compare across departments, age groups, and job titles.

### 2. **Turnover and Retrenchment Insights**
- **KPI:** Monitor the turnover and retrenchment rates in different departments.
- **Steps:**
  - Import retrenchment data (`Retrenchment.csv`) into Power BI.
  - Analyze the reasons for employee turnover and retrenchment.
  - Visualize trends to show which departments have the highest retrenchment rates.

### 3. **Performance vs. Promotion Correlation**
- **KPI:** Correlate employee performance ratings with promotion rates.
- **Steps:**
  - Import employee performance and satisfaction data (`HR Analytics Data.csv`).
  - Clean the data and create calculated fields to measure the correlation.
  - Visualize the relationships between performance ratings and promotions to identify top performers and potential gaps in promotion fairness.

### 4. **Employee Demographics Analysis**
- **KPI:** Provide a breakdown of employee demographics (age, gender, department) to support diversity and inclusion efforts.
- **Steps:**
  - Load employee demographic data (`HR employee data.csv`).
  - Create a dashboard showing demographic distribution across departments, age groups, and gender.
  - Enable filtering to allow HR teams to explore data for specific departments.

## Recommendations / Insights
- **Promotion Insights:** Promotion rates vary significantly between departments, with Sales and IT showing the highest rates. Training programs and mentoring opportunities can be implemented in departments with lower promotion rates to foster internal mobility.
- **Turnover and Retrenchment:** Departments with higher retrenchment rates may require targeted employee engagement initiatives, as employees are leaving within the first three years. Improved onboarding programs and continuous performance monitoring may help reduce turnover.
- **Performance Analysis:** High-performance employees tend to have higher satisfaction rates and are promoted more frequently. Frequent performance reviews and targeted professional development opportunities could help retain top talent.
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Analyzing the gender and age distribution in different departments can help improve diversity initiatives, ensuring equal opportunities for all employees.

## Technical Stack
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, allowing HR teams to explore and analyze key metrics.
- **Power Query:** For cleaning and transforming raw data from various CSV files into a usable format for visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized to create calculated columns and measures for custom KPIs and performance metrics.
- **Excel/CSV Files:** Used for storing and organizing raw HR data (employee demographics, promotions, retrenchments, etc.) before importing into Power BI.
- **GitHub:** Used for version control and collaboration (if applicable).
